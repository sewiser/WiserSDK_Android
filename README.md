Wiser Android Home SDK Sample
===
This sample demonstrates the use of Wiser Android Home SDK to build an IoT App from scratch. It divides into several function groups to give developers a clear insight into the implementation for different features, includes the user registration process, home management for different users, device network configuration, and controls. For device network configuration, EZ mode and AP mode are implemented, which let developers pair devices over Wi-Fi, as well as control them via LAN and MQTT. For device control, it supplies a common panel for sending and receiving any kind types of data points.
